            <h2>Pseudo Code :</h2>
            <strong>UPPER HULL :</strong>
            <pre><code>
             1. Initialize Points with Extreme x-coordinates:
                - Identify p_min and p_max as the points in S with the least and largest x-coordinates, respectively.
             
             2. Sorting Points:
                - Sort all points of S by their x-coordinate.
             
             3. Finding Median x-coordinate:
                - Determine the median x-coordinate m_x of the sorted points in S.
             
             4. Dividing the Set:
                - Divide S into two subsets based on m_x:
                  - S_left contains points with x(p) < m_x.
                  - S_right contains points with x(p) ≥ m_x.
             
             5. Vertical Line at Median:
                - Define L as the vertical line where x = m_x.
             
             6. Identifying Bridge Points:
                - Find points p_l and p_r on the upper bridge for S_left and S_right with respect to line L.
             
             7. Discarding Internal Points:
                - Discard points within the quadrilateral formed by p_min, p_l, p_r, and p_max.
                - The resulting subsets are S_left' and S_right'.
             
             8. Recursive Computation of Upper Hulls:
                - Compute the upper hull for the left subset recursively:
                  - H_left := UPPER-HULL(S_left').
                - Compute the upper hull for the right subset recursively:
                  - H_right := UPPER-HULL(S_right').
             
             9. Combining Left and Right Hulls:
                - Concatenate the hulls with the upper bridge to form the full upper hull:
                  - RETURN concatenation(H_left, [upper bridge], H_right).

            <h2>Time Complexity Analysis of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel Algorithm</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Overview:</h3>
  <p>The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm finds the convex hull of a set of points in O(N log H) time, where N is the total number of points and H is the number of points on the convex hull. The UPPER-HULL function is the main recursive driver, and UPPER-BRIDGE is a subroutine called at each recursive step to find the bridge.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Justification:</h3>
  <p>The justification for the time complexity of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm stems from the UPPER-BRIDGE function's ability to operate in linear time and the divide-and-conquer approach of UPPER-HULL.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Detailed Analysis:</h3>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collecting Input Points:</strong> Input collection is O(N), since it's a simple operation of storing the points.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Pairing Points in UPPER-BRIDGE:</strong> O(N/2) for pairing points, simplifying to O(N).</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Finding Median Slope in UPPER-BRIDGE:</strong> Median slope determination is O(N) using a linear-time median-finding algorithm.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Classifying Pairs in UPPER-BRIDGE:</strong> Classifying pairs into SMALL, EQUAL, and LARGE takes O(N).</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Supporting Line and Bridge Detection in UPPER-BRIDGE:</strong> O(N) for finding the supporting line h and determining bridge points.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Recursive Preparation in UPPER-BRIDGE:</strong> Linear-time operations for inserting candidates for recursive calls.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Recursive UPPER-HULL Calls:</strong> The UPPER-HULL function recursively halves the problem set, leading to a logarithmic number of calls, log H.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3>Total Time Complexity:</h3>
  <p>The total time complexity is a product of the linear operations within UPPER-BRIDGE and the logarithmic depth of recursion in UPPER-HULL, resulting in O(N log H).</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Best and Worst Case:</h3>
  <ul>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> The best case occurs when the recursive calls of UPPER-HULL quickly find the bridge, minimizing the number of recursive calls, yet it is still O(N) due to linear operations within UPPER-BRIDGE.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> The worst case is efficiently handled by ensuring the problem set is halved at each recursive step, maintaining the O(N log H) complexity.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
    <p>Space complexity is driven by the input storage and the recursion stack. Since the UPPER-BRIDGE function operates in-place for the most part, space complexity is O(N) for storing points, plus O(log H) for the recursion stack.</p>
    <br>

  <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm, through the linear-time operations of UPPER-BRIDGE and the divide-and-conquer approach of UPPER-HULL, achieves a time complexity of O(N log H). The algorithm remains efficient across both best and worst-case scenarios due to the careful pairing and classification of points and the logarithmic reduction of the problem set size in UPPER-HULL.</p>
