            <h2>Kirkpatrick-Seidel Algorithm Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In the realm of computational geometry, the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm emerges as a significant leap in solving the planar convex hull problem with a sophisticated approach. Conceptualized by David Kirkpatrick and Raimund Seidel, this algorithm redefines efficiency and precision in the computation of the convex hull, which is the smallest convex polygon enclosing a set of points in a plane. The KPS algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy that strategically decomposes the problem into more manageable sub-problems, processes these independently, and then combines the results in a way that adheres to the convexity properties required for the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
        Distinctive for its worst-case time complexity of O(n log h), where n represents the total number of points and h denotes the number of points on the hull itself, the KPS algorithm outperforms many of its contemporaries in scenarios where the convex hull has significantly fewer points than the input set. This complexity notation is particularly notable because it indicates that the algorithm scales logarithmically with the number of hull points—a feature that stands in stark contrast to other algorithms whose performance may degrade linearly with larger datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The underlying beauty of the KPS algorithm lies in its ingenious use of the 'prune-and-search' technique. This method iteratively discards portions of the input set that cannot be part of the convex hull, reducing the problem space with each iteration and thus narrowing down the search area for the remaining points. Through this progressive refinement, the algorithm converges on the optimal hull with a level of efficiency that is both theoretically and practically significant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its application transcends theoretical interest and extends into various practical domains, where computational efficiency and speed are paramount. From graphical data representation to pathfinding in robotics and beyond, the KPS algorithm provides a robust solution for determining the bounding convex shape that is critical for spatial analysis and decision-making processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm is not just a testament to computational expediency; it is also a work of art within algorithm design. It exemplifies how a complex problem, when deconstructed into simpler parts and tackled with a combination of precision and creativity, can be addressed in a way that is both elegantly simple and highly effective.

            <h2>Algorithm Details</h2>
    <p>
        The algorithm's procedure is rooted in mathematical rigor and is characterized by a sequence of geometrically informed steps. The following details offer an in-depth examination of each phase, elucidating the mathematical considerations and operations that guide the algorithm to its objective—the construction of a convex hull.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We will take following lemmas and corollaries in consideration while explaining the KPS algorithm.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Lemma 1: Vertical Elimination:</strong>If two points share the same x-coordinate, the one with the lesser y-coordinate cannot be part of the upper bridge. This lemma helps to reduce the candidate set by eliminating points that are 'underneath' others when projected onto a vertical line.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Lemma 2: Slope Comparison: </strong>Given two points with different x-coordinates, if the slope of the line connecting them is less than the slope of the upper bridge, then the point with the larger x-coordinate cannot be a bridge point. Conversely, if the slope is greater, the point with the smaller x-coordinate cannot be a bridge point. This lemma is crucial for discerning which points have the potential to be on the upper bridge based on slope analysis
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Lemma 3: Supporting Line Slope:</strong>This lemma concerns the slope of a supporting line, which is a line that contains at least one point of the set S and has no points of S above it. The lemma states that the slope of a supporting line that contains only points to the left of the median line will be greater than the slope of the upper bridge, and if it contains only points to the right, the slope will be less.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Corollary to Lemma 2 and 3: Candidate Elimination</strong>The corollary combines the insights from Lemmas 2 and 3 to aid in eliminating candidates for the upper bridge. If a supporting line is found to contain points only to one side of the median line and the comparison of slopes follows the rules set out in Lemmas 2 and 3, we can determine that certain points cannot be candidates for the end points of the bridge.
            </li>
            </ol>

    <ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Algorithm:</h2>
        <li>
            <strong>Initialization:</strong>Start by identifying the points with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates, denoted as p_min and p_max. These points are guaranteed to be part of the convex hull.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Divide :</strong> Find the median x-coordinate of the points to divide the set into two subsets. These subsets are separated by a vertical line L at the median x-coordinate.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Upper Bridge:</strong> Define the upper bridge, which is a segment connecting a point in the left subset to a point in the right subset. This segment is part of the convex hull's upper boundary.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Supporting Line and Slope Analysis:</strong> Determine the slopes of lines defined by pairs of points. This step incorporates Lemma 1 to eliminate any point below another with the same x-coordinate and Lemma 2 to consider the slope relative to the potential upper bridge.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Median Slope and Candidate Points:</strong> Find the median of the slopes of the lines determined from the pairs of points. Select candidate points for the next iteration based on their slope relative to the median slope.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Subset Partitioning:</strong> Partition the points into three groups based on their slope relative to the median slope: SMALL (less than the median), EQUAL (equal to the median), and LARGE (greater than the median).
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Supporting Line Selection:</strong> For each subset, find a supporting line with the slope equal to the median slope and determine the points that lie on this supporting line. Use Lemma 3 to infer the positioning of the points relative to the median vertical line.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Bridge Determination:</strong> Establish whether the supporting line contains the bridge by comparing the x-coordinates of points with maximum y-value minus the slope times the x-coordinate.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Candidates Update:</strong> Update candidate points based on the location relative to the median line using the corollary derived from Lemma 2 and Lemma 3. Points on the wrong side of the median slope are not potential bridge points
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Recursive Upper Bridge Construction:</strong> Recursively call the function to find the upper bridge with the updated candidates until the bridge is found or only two points remain, in which case these points form the upper bridge.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Upper Hull Construction:</strong> Combine the upper bridges found through recursion to construct the upper hull. Apply a similar process to construct the lower hull.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Merge:</strong> Merge the upper and lower hulls to form the complete convex hull of the set of points.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Kirkpatrick-Seidel Algorithm: Full Step-by-Step Example</h2>

    <br>
    Given points for the example: A(1,3), B(2,5), C(4,2), D(6,6), E(7,1), F(8,4).

    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Step 1: Initialization</strong>
        <p>Identify <strong>A(1,3)</strong> and <strong>F(8,4)</strong> based on the minimum and maximum x-coordinates as part of the convex hull.</p>
        <br>

        <strong>Step 2: Divide</strong>
        <p>Find the median x-coordinate (between C and D) and divide the points into two subsets: Left = {A, B, C}, Right = {D, E, F}.</p>

        <br>
        <strong>Step 3: Upper Bridge</strong>
        <p>Through slope comparisons and supporting lines, find the upper bridge connecting B(2,5) in the left subset to D(6,6) in the right subset.</p>
   
        <br>
     
        <strong>Step 4: Discarding Internal Points</strong>
        <p>Form a quadrilateral using A, F, B, and D. Remove points which are inside the quadrilateral and cannot be part of the convex hull.</p>
    
        <br>
        <strong>Step 5: Recursive Hull Construction</strong>
        <p>Recursively apply the steps to the subsets, but given the direct identification of the bridge, we proceed to the merge step.</p>
        <br>

     
        <strong>Step 6: Merging</strong>
        <p>Merge the convex hulls found in the recursive steps by connecting at the bridges to form a larger section of the overall convex hull.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 7: Lower Bridge and Lower Hull</strong>
        <p>Apply a mirrored process to find the lower hull of the set. Assume a lower bridge connects A(1,3) and E(7,1).</p>
    

        <br>
        <strong>Step 8: Final Assembly</strong>
        <p>Combine the upper and lower hulls to form the complete convex hull of the set.</p>
   

        <br>
        <strong>Step 9: Lemma 1 Application</strong>
        <p>Vertical Line Elimination was applied to ensure only the topmost point on the same vertical line was considered for the hull.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 10: Lemma 2 Application</strong>
        <p>Slope Comparison was crucial for determining the upper bridge by comparing slopes of potential bridge segments.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 11: Lemma 3 Application</strong>
        <p>Supporting Line Slope helped to further refine the bridge candidates based on the slopes of supporting lines.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 12: Corollary and Candidates Update</strong>
        <p>Updated candidate points for bridge endpoints were based on their slope relative to the median slope, applying the corollary derived from Lemmas 2 and 3.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
        <p>The convex hull formed by points A, B, D, F, E, and A encapsulates the given set, showcasing the effectiveness of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm in convex hull construction.</p>
